      '<p>Once you’ve absorbed the architectural marvel of Kyoto Station, head a few blocks west to find <a href="https://www.kurasu.kyoto/" class="addbackground">Kurasu Kyoto</a>—a stellar example of the way Kyoto blends tradition with the modern. Kurasu is small, but the cafe’s open and clean layout keeps you from feeling cramped. Traditional stonework floors are trafficked by patrons holding pour-overs, and the white ash counters make a good home for a matte black <a href="http://www.lamarzoccousa.com/portfolio/lineapb/" class="addbackground">La Marzocco Linea PB</a>.</p><p>Before a physical location was developed, Kurasu found its place in the coffee community by selling curated Japanese coffee-ware online, and later as a subscription service featuring Japanese roasters. Now in the real world, Kurasu Kyoto is part cafe and part showroom for the team’s favorite coffee tools and beans. A handcrafted mug filled with coffee from <a href="http://singleo.jp/" class="addbackground">Single O Japan</a> makes a good start to any day, especially one in Kyoto.</p>',

      '<p>Winning the award for Kyoto’s most interesting cafe location is <a href="http://www.weekenderscoffee.com/" class="addbackground">Weekenders Coffee</a> Tominokoji. Here in the back corner of a parking lot is a beautiful cafe built in the tradition of the city’s homes—a purposeful rebuke to the trend of Western cafe fads influencing coffeehouse design. Weekenders thinks of the parking lot as an air pocket between the quiet oasis of a cafe and the cramped Kyoto streets. While sipping on an espresso and staring at a mini fish pond, it’s true that the town feels miles away.</p><p>Weekenders Coffee roasts its own, and its coffees are on the lighter and brighter side of the spectrum. Fans of Scandinavian coffee will be pleased by the tart and vibrant flavors in each cup. Fans of Kyoto will be pleased by the hospitality and traditional design.</p>',

      '<p>Located below Piece Hostel Sanjo, down a suspiciously narrow set of stairs, is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.drpdrp.com/" class="addbackground">Drip &amp; Drop Coffee Supply</a>. Space is often at a premium in this old city, but this cafe is roomy. The lighting is dim, the seating is cozy, and the atmosphere is distilled hip. Those searching for a spot to recharge with a book, get a simple coffee cocktail, or grab a light lunch should steer toward this coffeehouse.</p><p>The baristas at Drip &amp; Drop are friendly and experienced when it comes to communicating with weary travelers. With four coffee blends to choose from and several brew methods on the menu, most visitors will find a combination that works for their palette. After hiking through a few hundred temples, a cup of iced coffee spiked with frozen fruit and mint ice cubes will amp you up for the next wave of sightseeing.</p>',

      '<p>The scrappy young team from Tokyo’s <a href="http://lightupcoffee.com/" class="addbackground">Light Up Coffee</a> recently took a big step in its mission to spread better coffee across the country by opening a location in Kyoto. Steps away from the banks of the Kamo River, nestled in a shopping street, Light Up serves specialty coffee to locals and tourists.</p><p>Light Up Coffee’s offerings are subtle and understated, allowing the drinker to pick out the flavors of each cup carefully while slowly sipping. Kyoto seems to be a perfect match for this style: deliberate, careful, and full of hidden beauty. Traveling coffee geeks will notice that the ceiling lamps are modeled after espresso tampers. Everyone will appreciate the cheery brightness of the decor and the coffee.</p>',

The cafe’s walls, floors, and counters are all in shades of white but the warm yellow glow of the lighting keeps the space from feeling sterile.</p><p>Widely known as a latte-art specialty shop, this store places a lot of emphasis on presentation. That being said, a creamy latte crafted on a Slayer espresso machine may be just what you need for your walk over to Kiyomizu-dera or Ninezaka.</p>',
